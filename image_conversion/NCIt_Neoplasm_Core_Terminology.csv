C8567;Visual Pathway Glioma;Glioma of Visual Pathway ;A glioma that arises from the visual pathway. This condition can be seen in association with neurofibromatosis 1. It is most commonly seen in the pediatric age group.;Undetermined;
C6380;Vulvar Adenocarcinoma;Adenocarcinoma of Vulva ;An adenocarcinoma that arises from the vulva. Representative examples include Bartholin gland adenocarcinoma, eccrine adenocarcinoma, apocrine adenocarcinoma, and sebaceous carcinoma.;Malignant;
C6381;Vulvar Basal Cell Carcinoma;Basal Cell Carcinoma of Vulva ;A slow growing, locally infiltrating carcinoma that arises from the vulva. It is characterized by the presence of malignant cells that resemble the basal cells that are present in the epidermis.;Malignant;
C4866;Vulvar Carcinoma;Cancer of Vulva ;A carcinoma arising from the vulva.  It usually affects elderly women but has been observed in premenopausal women as well.  The most frequently seen histologic type is squamous cell carcinoma. The most common site of involvement is the labia majora.  In many cases, the development of vulvar cancer is preceded by condyloma or squamous dysplasia.;Malignant;
C4027;Vulvar Paget Disease;Paget Disease of the Vulva ;An uncommon intraepithelial malignant neoplasm of eccrine or apocrine origin, arising from the vulva.  It usually affects post-menopausal women.  In approximately 10-20% of the cases there is an associated anorectal, or urothelial carcinoma or a skin appendage adenocarcinoma identified.  It presents as a red, eczematous lesion.  Microscopically, it is characterized by the presence of the typical Paget cells which are large, round cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli.;Malignant;
C4052;Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Epidermoid Carcinoma of Vulva ;A squamous cell carcinoma that arises from the vulva. It is classified as human papillomavirus-related or human papillomavirus-independent. When p16 immunohistochemistry or HPV testing is not available, the morphological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, not otherwise specified is acceptable.;Malignant;
C80307;Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia;Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia ;Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma associated with bone marrow involvement and IgM monoclonal gammopathy.;Malignant;
C2854;Warthin Tumor;Adenolymphoma ;A benign tumor that arises from the salivary gland and is characterized by the presence of an oncocytic, often papillary epithelial component, dense lymphoid stroma, and cystic spaces. It occurs primarily in the parotid gland and is the second most common benign parotid gland tumor (after pleomorphic adenoma). A strong association with smoking has been reported. It typically presents as a painless swelling in the lower portion of the parotid gland.;Benign;
C9389;Well Differentiated Leiomyosarcoma;;Grade I malignant smooth muscle neoplasm.  It is characterized by a proliferation of neoplastic spindle cells.;Malignant;
C7635;Well Differentiated Papillary Mesothelial Tumor;Well-Differentiated Mesothelial Papillary Neoplasm ;A localized or multifocal mesothelial neoplasm arising from the peritoneum and less often the pleura and paratesticular region. Cases arising from the peritoneum predominantly occur in women. It is characterized by the formation of papillae, covered by a single layer of blunt mesothelial cells. Mitotic figures are not present. There is no evidence of severe cytologic atypia. It has a relatively favorable clinical outcome, compared to malignant mesothelioma.;Undetermined;
C3267;Wilms Tumor;Nephroblastoma ;An embryonal neoplasm characterized by the presence of epithelial, mesenchymal, and blastema components. The vast majority of cases arise from the kidney. A small number of cases with morphologic features resembling Wilms tumor of the kidney have been reported arising from the ovary and the cervix.;Malignant;
C3011;Yolk Sac Tumor;Endodermal Sinus Neoplasm ;A non-seminomatous malignant germ cell tumor composed of primitive germ cells.  It is the most common malignant germ cell tumor in the pediatric population. It occurs in the infant testis, ovary, sacrococcygeal region, vagina, uterus, prostate, abdomen, liver, retroperitoneum, thorax, and pineal/third ventricle. The tumor mimics the yolk sac of the embryo and produces alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Treatment includes: surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. This tumor is very responsive to chemotherapy regimens that include cisplatinum.;Malignant;
